# WSTG-CheckList
The OWASP-Based Web Application Security Testing Checklist is an Excel-based tool designed to help track the status of completed and pending test cases effectively.

This checklist is fully aligned with the OWASP Testing Guide v5, which provides a comprehensive framework for conducting penetration tests. It includes both a “best practice” penetration testing framework for organizational implementation and a detailed “low-level” penetration testing guide that outlines techniques for identifying and testing the most common web application security vulnerabilities, mapped to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration).

Additionally, the checklist features an OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator and a Summary Findings Template to facilitate streamlined reporting and risk evaluation.
